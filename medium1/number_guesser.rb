# Create an object-oriented number guessing class for numbers in the range 1 to 100, 
# with a limit of 7 guesses per game. The game should play like this:

# The computer will display a message informing how many guesses the player has
# The computer will prompt the player for a message
# If the guess is too high (outside of the 1-100 range) prompt invalid message
# if the number is valid inform the user if it is too low, too high, you you win!
# if the number of guesses are reached without a correct guess, inform you are out of guesses, you lose!
